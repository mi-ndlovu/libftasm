# libftasm
This is wethinkcode first Kernel project.
The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language. 

# General Instructions
1) The library must be called libfts.a.
2) You must compile your assembly code with nasm.
3) You must write 64 bits ASM.
4) You can’t do inline ASM, you must do ’.s’ files.
6) You must use the Intel syntax, not the AT&T.
7) You must submit a main that will test your functions and that will compile with
your library to show that it’s functional.

# How to run the tests
$> make 
$> make run
